      <p class="text">Our robot team was in charge of building and programming a robot that would allow us to defeat our biggest challenge: <i>Invicta</i>. Our robot is our most crucial weapon, it protects us as well as permits us to defeat threats. For months, this team has been in the training hall surpassing their limits, building and reconstructing prototype after prototype to reach their desired goal. </p>

      <p class="text">The Marcelline warriors managed to build the perfect robot, but due to unusual malfunction, it was destroyed. Here are all necessary informations to build the robot: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="text">The robot is made of three main parts, the base, the input and the ball slide. </li>
          <li class="text">The base anchors the robot to the field. </li>
          <li class="text"> The axis rotates which allows the input to move around the field. </li>
          <img class="image-side" src="../images/robot9.jpg" alt="The robot's intake on the playing field.">
          <img class="image-side" src="../images/robot8.jpg" alt="The robot's circuit">
          <img class="image-side" src="../images/robot10.jpg" alt="The robot on the playing field">
          <li class="text">The input is attached to the horizontal lift. The horizontal lift extends the input in order for it to reach the game pieces.</li>
          <li class="text">As soon as the structure is done, the rod will be used as a slide for the ball to fall into the hoop.</li>
          <li class="text">The robot is composed of t-slotted, 11 omni wheels and 5 motors. The CRC duino is located in the base.</li>

        </ul>
      <p class="text">Beforehand, the construction team arranged wheels on the robot, but they soon realized that they weren&rsquo;t obligated to do so. In November 2020, they rebuilt a new prototype for their desired robot. In addition, the programming team tested on motors, sensors and did the competition&rsquo;s programming practices.  </p>

    <h3 class="subheader">Overcoming New Challenges</h3>
      <p class="text">The robot team encountered several challenges throughout the expected journey. The preliminary rules were displayed before the game launched. Following this event, the construction team had a vague idea about the game’s concept yet the necessary instructions were yet to be divulged. Consequently, the team planned wheels for the robot. However, after the game launch, they concluded that those wheels were an inconvenience. Therefore following the news, in November, they created a new prototype for their desired outcome. The very first robot they designed, was planned with a conveyor belt, wheels and a pegboard. Having a conveyor belt made the execution complicated and the pegboard simply made the robot heavier. The programming team had issues with the circuits, encoders and Python. They took the matter into their own hands and tried to problem-solve throughout the month of November.
