    <p class="text"> For a long time, the CRC has been trying to build a wonderful machine that would bring peace in the world. They are known to be a non-profit organization who run an annual robotics competition to challenge the students of nowadays, giving them a new opportunity to learn new assets. Students around the nation gather together for three days to compete in different fields such as programming, construction of the robot, building a kiosk, creating a website and video and incorporating 3D drawings in all of those. In this way, both the students and CRC have been growing in every field: mathematics, arts, science, computer, languages, technology and engineering.

    <p class="text"> A few months prior, the experiment went horribly wrong! Lord Shen sought vengeance, after his defeat by the Furious Five. So, he snuck into the CRC&rsquo;s top-secret lab and hacked into the system taking control of their machine and turned it evil. When they came into the lab, in the morning, their machine was standing and ready to attack them. Invicta escaped, leaving CRC in awe, and terrorized the Valley of Peace, threatening ultimate destruction upon them.  The Valley of Peace, home to the warriors whom Lord Shen lost to, was targeted by his strong desire for revenge.</p>
    <img class="img" src="../images/invicta.png" alt="Invicta 2021 Logo">
    <p class="text"> Knowing that the Valley of Peace was in jeopardy, CRC decided to join forces with the warriors to take down Invicta once and for all! If we win the battle, it would leave us alone. The one to accumulate the most points by building the most complex structures will be victorious. 
      <br><br>
        The combat will take place as follows: 
        <ol class="text">
          <li>In a time period of 5 minutes, build the structures chosen at the beginning, with the help of designated different shaped blocks. </li>
          <br><li>The field is divided into 7 sections: where the robot starts on and what the structure will be constructed on. The remainder of the sections regroups different types of pieces of wood designated.</li>

          <br><li>Each structure has a different level of difficulty. They vary from easiest to hardest with points accustomed to it.</li>
          <br><li>Once the structure is completed, take the ball and place it in the hoop situated in the corner of the field for the points to be secured. Additionally, it serves as a point multiplier.</li>
          <br><li>However, if the structure collapses in any circumstances or is incomplete, no bonus points will be awarded.</li>
          <br><li>Each piece of wood of various shapes gives a respective amount of points. The total of points will count those of the structure and those of each piece of wood multiplied by the bonus of the ball.</li>
