          <p class="text">March 13, 2020, the beginning of a long, mandatory, confinement took place as a pandemic struck the entire world including the Valley of Peace. Fighting against the pandemic, along with <i>Invicta</i>, the <i>Valley of Peace</i> desperately needed help. A team of twenty-six brilliant warriors was formed on the 10th of April, 2020.</p>
          <img class="images" src="../images/peachgrove/team.jpg" alt="Meeting with all the Warriors at Marcy Palace">
          <p class="text">While we were all struggling to find a way to train, on May 6, 2020, our mentor reunited us with a human technology called ZOOM. It was the only way we could see each other. Time passed and we trained in units based on our strongest assets: 3D design, programming, construction, website creation, video and kiosk.  All these powers are necessary to build the perfect weapon to defeat <i>Invicta</i>. </p>

          <p class="text">On August 31st, 2020, we learned some devastating news, <i>Invicta</i> destroyed all of the materials to build the kiosk. We did not surrender! The kiosk warriors trained even harder to learn new assets. Then September came and we were reunited at <i>Marcy’s Palace</i>, where each warrior gained new knowledge and powers.

          <p class="text">The programmers finalized writing the code for the robot and decided to test it out with the CRC Duino. Although the first attempts were unsuccessful, they were eager and persisted in enhancing the line of code. To gain as much knowledge as possible, they sought to solve their programming issues. Moreover, in that same month, they had to find a code that could solve any Sudoku puzzle.</p>
